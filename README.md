#Movie_Recommender_System
The content-based recommendations were used to build the movie recommender system, 
which makes movie recommendations based on the provided film. 
The machine learning model was created using machine learning algorithms. 
The movie-recommender-system's website was created using Pycharm and Streamlit.
The movie titles and movie posters are listed on the website.
